# G-Sender-with-Servo
This is an Offline GRBL Controller which is Specifically designed for CNC Plotters Made with Servo as its Z-axis

This Smart Controller contains a SD-Card reader, a rotary encoder and a LCD1602 display. You can easy connect it to your GRBL controller boardï¼ˆmust have 5V/GND/TX/RX port. After connecting this panel to your GRBL controller board you don't need your pc any more. All actions like calibration, axis and servo movements can be done by just using the rotary encoder on the Smart Controller. Machining your designs without PC, just with a g-code design stored on the SD card.
